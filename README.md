###This is a simple tweak that allows theming UIImages (UIKit and other .artwork resource images) in an easy and fast way. 

##To use it:
	1. Create a plist in /User/Library/Preferences/ called com.bensge.uiimages.plist
	2. Created a string called "themePath" in the plist. The value of the string is the path to the uiimages folder of the theme
	3. You can just swap out all the other images and you have a way faster alternative to winterboard then ;)


Thanks to Brian Cooper for the inspiration and testing :)
